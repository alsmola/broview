AckAboveHole

AddressDropIgnored 
scan 
A request to drop connectivity has been ignored ; (scan detected, but one of these ﬂags is true: !can drop connectivity, or never shut down, or never drop nets )

scan 
Apparent ﬂooding backscatter seen from source 
ClearToEncrypted_SS 
stepping 
A stepping stone was seen in which the ﬁrst part of the chain is a clear-text connection but the second part is encrypted. This often means that a password or passphrase has been exposed in the clear, and may also mean that the user has an incomplete notion that their connection is protected from eavesdropping.

SensitiveSignature 
signatures 
generic for alarm-worthy 
SensitiveUsernameInPassword 
login 
During a login dialog, a sensitive username (e.g., "rewt") was seen in the user’s password. This is reported as a notice because it could be that the login analyzer didn’t track the authentication dialog correctly, and in fact what it thinks is the user’s password is instead the user’s username.
